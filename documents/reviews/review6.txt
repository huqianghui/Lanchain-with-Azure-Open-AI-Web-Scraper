                To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Top positive reviewPositive reviews› Benson5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent productReviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023I had an Ikea electric sit and stand desk which is double the price of this and it is nowhere comparable to this desk. This desk has dual motors, the desktop is thicker and stronger and the hydraulic mechanism is way responsive and smoother even the desk has a 19kg piano keyboard and 9 kg monitor + arm combo permanently, plus it has a few memory settings. Highly recommended.

Superior desk for the money
Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2023Size Name: 140x70 ProColour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
This is a superior desk at this price point, and size. The single piece desktop is impossible to find elsewhere for this price.The height is very easy to adjust, and operates smoothly.The legs are very sturdy (much better than my similar desk from a Swedish store).The desk arrived in two separate packages a couple of days apart, with no damage.

Best bang for buck
Reviewed in the United States on 13 October 2023Verified Purchase
Setup took less than an hour and was relatively easy.  Not the best instructions but there was is a YouTube.  I got the black and vintage desk.  The color is phenomenal and the desk is sturdy.

Great product, great customer service
Reviewed in the United States on 2 October 2023Size Name: 140x70Colour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
I’ve ordered two FlexSpot standing desks and also recommended them to friends. After 2 years of actively using the standing desk feature, one leg stopped moving. Customer service offered to replace the leg but first helped me troubleshoot and ultimately resolve the problem which ended up being a connection issue. I’m very pleased with the product as well as the customer support!

Brian K. Wilkes5.0 out of 5 stars
Went together great, extremely pleased and it operates perfectly!
Reviewed in the United States on 17 September 2023Verified Purchase
I had no issues described in some earlier reviews.  However I would add the appropriate sized washers beneath screw heads  (6 of them) where the table top mounts at the shock/vibration bumpers.  I didn’t need to but I believe many are not tightening the screws all of the way in fear of crushing the protruding bit of bumper sleeve.  You have to.  The supplied pop-in bumpers are made that way to make alignment easier and less troublesome during assembly.  See pic for example without washer.

Great desk!
Reviewed in the United States on 25 September 2023Size Name: 120x60Colour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
I’ve had this for two months and love it! I got a certain WFH set up from work so that’s how I knew what size I would need for my equipment. I did wait for it to be on sale because it is expensive. So far no issues and I love being able to stand now! It did take two people to put it together and move. It’s much heavier than I expected!

Sturdy desk
Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2023Size Name: 152x60 ProColour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
Sturdy and good quality desk but the shipping box was damaged one side so I didn’t think it would be damaged inside but the one side (front corner) has been damaged from all the shipping. We noticed it after we put together the legs and other Parts. We kept it, anyways! I’ll probably stick some white tape or paint white to conceal it.

Good product, but not short enough for kids
Reviewed in the United States on 5 October 2023Verified Purchase
I bought this for my 7 and 5yo hoping they could adjust the height to fit them as they grow, but it just doesn't go that low. It's lowest setting is probably fit for a small adult, like myself. Otherwise, it's a good product and we'll keep it anyway.

Great Desk
Reviewed in the United States on 4 October 2023Verified Purchase
This is a great desk for working from home. I work 9-10 hour shifts, 5 days a week, and sitting those long hours started hurting my neck and back. But with this desk, I now have the option to stand, which makes working long hours endurable.

Love this desk
Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2023Size Name: 100cm TopColour Name: BambooVerified Purchase
This desk is perfect. Is exactly as described. I liked it so much that my fiancé got the same one and I ended up getting my work to purchase one for a room there. Setup is pretty straightforward.

Low profile, works well so far.
Reviewed in the United States on 5 September 2023Verified Purchase
Took under an hour to assemble and the screws/pieces lined up better than most other furniture I’ve ordered online. Smallest size is perfect for a laptop on a riser, 1 monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a cup of coffee. Glad I opted for this one over other brands with a 2-piece desk top - since I’m using with a walking pad, my typing while walking makes the whole thing wobble just a tad and the single-piece still top feels stable. Love that this just has 2 buttons and comes with cable management clips to keep everything looking very low-profile. Hopefully this lasts a long time!
