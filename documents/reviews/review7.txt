                How are ratings calculated?
            

                To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Top positive reviewPositive reviews› Benson5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent productReviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023I had an Ikea electric sit and stand desk which is double the price of this and it is nowhere comparable to this desk. This desk has dual motors, the desktop is thicker and stronger and the hydraulic mechanism is way responsive and smoother even the desk has a 19kg piano keyboard and 9 kg monitor + arm combo permanently, plus it has a few memory settings. Highly recommended.

One of the few single piece tops at a good price point.
Reviewed in the United States on 13 September 2023Size Name: 140x70 ProColour Name: Maple TopVerified Purchase
This desk has a single piece top which is greatly appreciated. There are no seems for your mouse or pen to catch on. It's not too loud when it moves. Moves smoothly, haven't had my coffee slosh about. Has a wide variety of sizes.My only complaint, and this is likely FedEx, is that it shipped in 2 packages and they showed up nearly 2 weeks apart.

I wish it would go lower
Reviewed in the United States on 26 September 2023Verified Purchase
It’s a great desk, I should have measured how low I wanted the desk to go, but it didn’t occur to me given that it is adjustable. I’m short and wish the desk would go lower so that it wouldn’t be awkwardly high when I am sitting.

Somewhat easy to install, sturdy, good quality
Reviewed in the United States on 25 September 2023Size Name: 140x70 ProColour Name: Maple TopVerified Purchase
It was somewhat simple to install, there were a couple of instructions that took a while to figure out. Other than that, the desk is of great quality, smooth and sturdy. The height adjustment feature works well so far.

Surprisingly nice & sturdy
Reviewed in the United States on 26 September 2023Size Name: 120x60 ProColour Name: White TopVerified Purchase




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I like the end result. However, after step 7 I got a little confused about the placement of the adapter bracket. There are two holes in it, so I thought I was missing some screws and the frame was missing some holes. Turns out it just attaches without any screws. I had to take a break at this point because it was annoying. Anyhow, the end result is really nice and it is very sturdy. The table is solid, and it does not wiggle at all. If your table is wobbly, just adjust the feet by either turning left or right to adjust the height as most wood floors are not even. The motor runs very nicely as well in moving the table up and down quite nicely and quickly. Overall, I’m very impressed. Please note that the filing cabinet does not come with the table. I bought that separately.

good value for the money
Reviewed in Canada on 17 July 2023Verified Purchase
WFH desk seems to be good value for the money as they offer 1 of the better warranties in this price range ($300-$500). While shopping for my electric standing desk, I came across 1 for @ $800.00 with a 1 year warranty (if they have little faith in their product, then I have even less)... went with the FlexiSpot EN1

Simple desk!
Reviewed in the United States on 6 July 2023Verified Purchase
It took me some time to build this desk bc it was 2 am and I was trying to be quiet lol but this desk so far is great! My old desk was good but after buying a newer desk chair that go higher I figured it was time for me to replace my squeaky and creaky desk for a new standing desk! It’s heavy af but that’s good bc if I bump into it my desktop and lamp won’t topple over. I do wish the cord for the motor was a little longer so I could place my desk differently while still being able to reach the outlet. I’ve had it for about 3 weeks now and things are good! If I had the means I would’ve definitely looked into the bigger desks this brand has! I will absolutely be looking at them in the future.Was very late in delivery however it wasn’t the company’s fault at all. The customer service was beyond so nice to me lol that’s why I will definitely buy in the future.
