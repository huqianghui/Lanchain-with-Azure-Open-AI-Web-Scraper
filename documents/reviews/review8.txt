                To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Top positive reviewPositive reviews› Benson5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent productReviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023I had an Ikea electric sit and stand desk which is double the price of this and it is nowhere comparable to this desk. This desk has dual motors, the desktop is thicker and stronger and the hydraulic mechanism is way responsive and smoother even the desk has a 19kg piano keyboard and 9 kg monitor + arm combo permanently, plus it has a few memory settings. Highly recommended.

Can’t say enough about it
Reviewed in the United States on 23 September 2023Size Name: 140x70cmColour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
Love this desk. Love it! It’s sleek and simple, EASY to put together, and looks amazing. I have put a bunch of furniture together in my life and this was probably the easiest (did it myself in an hour). Fabulous desk!

Perfect? No. Fantastic price to performance?  Oh yes.
Reviewed in the United States on 19 May 2023Size Name: 120cm TopColour Name: Grey WoodVerified Purchase
I just received and assembled this desk today.  I got the "5 minute" assembly model....LOL yeah right.  It took me 30 minutes.  Was it hard? No.  Could I do it in 5 minutes as advertised?  Sure, if I had a NASCAR pit crew working with me.  Having said that, it was not difficult and I am VERY impressed with the quality of the unit.  It came out looking fantastic (especially the white metal anodized painted parts).  I kept thinking...wow, this is fitting together REALLY nicely. Once it was assembled I had a few observations:1. The top I chose was grey...except it's not really grey.  I would call it more of a very neutral light brown. Very Very neutral.  Don't get me wrong, it is very nice especially with the white legs, but grey...?  Not really.2.  Quiet!  Holy Molly is this thing quite when it goes up and down.3. Memory!  The standing and sitting memory buttons are gold.  Love them.4. TALLLLLLL!  I am 6'3" and this thing goes higher than I even need.  I would say this would easily satisfy someone 6'5" in the standing positions.5. The Basket.....wow this stupid little under the desk hidden basket is fantastic.  I put my power strip in it and now the back of my desk is clean clean clean.  One cord going in.  Love it.6.  Design.....sweet.  The box said made in Vietnam but I could care less.  It is VERY well designed.  Time will tell on the motor and over all longevity, but so far for $225 bucks I am VERY impressed.At the end of the day I could not be happier.  I hope this desk lasts forever and contributes to my over all good health.

Good Quality, Not Great Instructions
Reviewed in the United States on 28 July 2023Size Name: 152x60 ProColour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
This is a great quality desk and was delivered promptly. The product came in two packages, desktop and stand. All items were packaged very well so damage during shipping is highly unlikely. The overall quality of the desktop and stand seems pretty good. The only issue I had was with the instructions. The instructions were written to apply to all desktop sizes so when it says "adjust to size" you really don't know what that means as there are no marking. So, when you get to that step, just slide the pieces apart and level them loose so you can adjust them to the correct width a few steps later. Overall this seems to be a great desk at a reasonable price.

Great desk/horrible to put together - honest review
Reviewed in the United States on 1 May 2023Size Name: 140x70 ProColour Name: Maple TopVerified Purchase
I based my purchase off my research and what I needed also quality of the product. This desk is a great buy but not as easy to put together. There were extra screws in the packaging which drove me crazy because I kept recounting and reviewing my steps to what I missed, the crossbar that goes under the desk should have had 2 stickers where the max line was to extend the bar to but it didn’t. It was not a great time trying to figure that out. Once i figured it out and tried to “tighten” the loose internal screw it fell thru the hole into the abyss of the metal frame, awesome.  Trying to figure out the adapter hanging compartment was not per instructions. The holes on the underside to attach the frame to the desktop either weren’t lined up correctly or just NOT there. I tried to call customer service and it was pointless the man on the other side of the line I could barely hear, he had a screaming kid in the background so I just hung up and tried to figure it out myself. Finally after 2.5 hours I was able to get my desk together and up  and running.This is not a simple 2 person job, I have put together many of ikea furniture before and this was horrible.Overall now that I got the desk up, it’s great no issues so far. Quiet motor for adjustment and height movement.I took off a star rating for all the issues I had putting it together, otherwise would have been a 5 star. For the time and effort in my search I chose this desk for all the positive reviews, the desk top comes in 1 pieces and it’s a solid desk.Hopefully no one else goes thru all the issues I have in the future with this purchase.Good luck !

It does what it's supposed to still. Only con for me is the length of time I've had it and how it's already messing up. Lasted less than a year for me. A screw came loose and cannot be tightened anymore which makes the desk wobbly.

Instructions
Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2023Size Name: 120x60 ProColour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
The instructions were clean and seemed clear but execution of explaining details gave me difficulty when trying to align the table board with the legs. There’s more lol screwing unscrewing screwing and unscrewing. I finally got everything put together after 2 1/2 hours. Was a challenge but it is finished and works great. Super cool height adjusting table.

So far so good!
Reviewed in Canada on 6 October 2023Size Name: 140x70 ProColour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
I bought this table after returning the one I bought from IKEA because the motor broke the first day we assembled the table.Before I chose this brand, I went back and forth for weeks trying to evaluate and read the reviews of different models in Amazon.I was skeptical about buying an office table from Amazon at first instance. But eventually settled for this table and we are very happy with the performance so far!It was also easy to assemble and it looks solid.

Random Pricing

I like this desk a lot but the price fluctuates so much and I ended up paying more than it was listed a week later – the seller never responded to my message about it either.
