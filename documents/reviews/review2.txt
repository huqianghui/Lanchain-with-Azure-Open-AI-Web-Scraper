                How are ratings calculated?
            

                To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Top positive reviewPositive reviews› Benson5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent productReviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023I had an Ikea electric sit and stand desk which is double the price of this and it is nowhere comparable to this desk. This desk has dual motors, the desktop is thicker and stronger and the hydraulic mechanism is way responsive and smoother even the desk has a 19kg piano keyboard and 9 kg monitor + arm combo permanently, plus it has a few memory settings. Highly recommended.

Relatively easy install, does the job
Reviewed in Australia on 14 June 2023Size Name: 120x60Colour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
This was relatively easy to put together, and having 2 people is probably necessary in terms of holding things up etc. Desk looks great. I received maple top instead of the white as ordered but was offered the choice of either a small refund for incorrect top of returning/getting new one. Opted for refund just because it's easier and quicker. Maple top still looks lovely and the size is perfect for an at-home office. If you're not elevating your monitor/laptop with arms then you probably would want a bigger size than my 120x60 but for me, without those on the desktop taking up space, it's perfect. Can recommend :)

Compact and good value
Reviewed in Australia on 19 July 2023Size Name: 100cm TopColour Name: BambooVerified Purchase
Assembly is a breeze.The desk itself is on the smaller side, but not uncomfortably so. For my laptop and monitor there's plenty of space, plus room for bits and bobs.It's not super sturdy. There's a definite wobble when extended to standing height. But nothing serious or distracting. I would buy this desk again rather than a more expensive one.

Feels sturdy and small enough it can be put together by one person the 100cm desk. I got the bamboo top and looks similar to ikea bamboo. Easier to put together than ikea bekant desk.

Great Desk, Great Price
Reviewed in Australia on 9 June 2023Size Name: 140x70Colour Name: Black TopVerified Purchase
Awesome basic desk at this price point with basic up and down controls, no position memory, which is fine with me. I have mounted heavy 8" studio monitors and a 32 inch Monitor mounted to the desk and it handles the weight fine and travels up and down just fine as well. Plenty of desk top space. Definitely recommend.
