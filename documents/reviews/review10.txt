                To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Top positive reviewPositive reviews› Benson5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent productReviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023I had an Ikea electric sit and stand desk which is double the price of this and it is nowhere comparable to this desk. This desk has dual motors, the desktop is thicker and stronger and the hydraulic mechanism is way responsive and smoother even the desk has a 19kg piano keyboard and 9 kg monitor + arm combo permanently, plus it has a few memory settings. Highly recommended.

Hopefully You Receive Instructions, Otherwise Good
Reviewed in the United States on 23 September 2023Size Name: 120x60Colour Name: Maple TopVerified Purchase
Did not come with written instructions, a bit of an "explorative" assembly process. However, the desk itself is sturdy and works well thusfar.

Actual customer service!
Reviewed in the United States on 20 August 2023Size Name: 120x60Colour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
Short version: Would recommend, sturdy, clean, simple desk, with helpful tech support.We bought this desk in March, and now five months later just had an issue with Up button not responding after unplugging the desk to move it.  I contacted customer service and they actually responded quickly with instructions to try, AND IT WORKED.  Motor seems totally fine now, good as new.The motor is quiet, the function is simple, the desktop is nice and thick and sturdy.  The desk doesn’t wobble, feels so stable.  It’s perfect!

amazing customer service!!
Reviewed in the United States on 13 August 2023Verified Purchase
I bought this desk about 2 years ago and it's still in great condition. I use it for work and even though I'm lazy about using it for full standing mode, it's great to get my laptop to a good height for Zoom calls. I had some damage with one of my wires from cat sitting today so I reached out directly to their website to see if I can buy a replacement part for the control panel & Cristian was super helpful and helped me process a replacement!! He was super responsive and able to get it figured out quickly. thank u so much!!

Everything You Want/Need in an Adjustable Desk
Reviewed in the United States on 14 May 2023Size Name: 120cm TopColour Name: BambooVerified Purchase
I love everything about this desk. I did a lot of comparing when it came to buying a new desk. I decided to go with a desk that can also stand up if needed. This desk met all of the criteria I was looking for. It has a solid top. I was surprised to see that many stand up desks consists of 2 panels for the top. I know having a seam in the middle of my desktop would drive me crazy so I made sure to get one that was solid. It has buttons that you can preset it to specific standing height and sitting height. I know it doesn’t take much to hold the buttons down to get to where you need it but it’s really nice to have it go to your go to settings at the push of a button. On the button panel there is also a usb and usb c port. It has a cable management basket underneath that has greatly minimized the view of cables. I can’t stand seeing a bunch of cables and this helps so much. There are 2 hooks on each side of the desk to hold headphones. It was very easy to assemble. being that the top is solid, you are basically just attaching the cable management tray, headphone hooks, control panel and legs. The desk is also very sturdy. I was so worried about getting a desk that would wobble when standing but this one is very solid. I have zero complaints about this desk and highly recommend it.

Excellent value
Reviewed in the United States on 9 September 2023Verified Purchase
This desk is great quality, and great value for your money. Way better price than other standing desks and so easy to put together. My 55” x 24” is plenty of workspace but also easy to move around/rearrange with other furniture.

Height Adjusting Flexibility is Outstanding!
Reviewed in the United States on 24 June 2023Size Name: 140x70Colour Name: Maple TopVerified Purchase
I am a multi-material artist working in both print and fabric. I wanted to replace a fixed desk with an electric adjusting desk. I didn't want to lose working area, though. This large table top (55"x28") was within a couple inches of my old table, providing all the working area I need, whether using my cutters and laptops or sewing board. The part that is really neat is that I can raise and lower the table with just a simple push of the button verses using a hand crank. The smooth operation of this electrical motor is great and it avoids the added space of a manual crank. My husband assembled the desk relatively easily in a couple hours with only one mistake requiring a relatively minor correction. The table leg/motor system is designed to fit multiple desk top sizes; the system will arrive in two packages, one with the table top and one with the legs. The electrical cord (10 feet long) is more than ample for my use. I am already reaping the benefits of being able to sit or stand with the touch of a button to the proper height for each job, reducing lower back stress. Also, the light oak table top and white leg finishes really make the room more open and inviting.

Good vertical range
Reviewed in Canada on 15 October 2023Size Name: 120x60Colour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
Assembled the desk single-handedly about 2 weeks ago. May need a hand when putting the top on. The desk as well as the legs are quite heavy (heavier than a regular IKEA desk of the same size) so, feels sturdy. It is missing two holes from the middle which had to be done manually when putting it together. But it is of minor concern. Everything else is good. Smoothly goes up and down. Vertical range is good.Slightly expensive in terms of the price!

Sturdy; excellent quality for the price
Reviewed in the United States on 28 August 2023Verified Purchase
Exactly what we needed for our home office. The husband and I bought two desks and put them side by side, because we each have multiple large screen monitors. They were not the easiest to put together, but also not the most difficult. We were impressed with the quality and are considering buying a third desk for his 3D printers.

Very good reliable computer desk
Reviewed in the United States on 3 August 2023Size Name: 120x60 ProColour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
bought this to upgrade office space and it works out perfectly. The desk is adjustable with heights and you can see the actual height through the control panel. We bought a very common size but I see you can choose from a variety sizes to fit your office space. The assembling process is a bit long as we are not very experienced in furniture, however with the help of the manual included in the box, we figured out really quick without any help from others. Tried for a few days and commenting now as I felt this is a good furniture to have and brought us more flexibility in office design.
