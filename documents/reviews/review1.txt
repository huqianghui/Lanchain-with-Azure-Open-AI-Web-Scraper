                How are ratings calculated?
            

                To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Top positive reviewPositive reviews› Benson5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent productReviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023I had an Ikea electric sit and stand desk which is double the price of this and it is nowhere comparable to this desk. This desk has dual motors, the desktop is thicker and stronger and the hydraulic mechanism is way responsive and smoother even the desk has a 19kg piano keyboard and 9 kg monitor + arm combo permanently, plus it has a few memory settings. Highly recommended.

The desk is very solid and heavy and is a quality piece of furniture. I like it so much I bought a second one.

Stable and great
Reviewed in Australia on 3 September 2023Size Name: 140x70 ProColour Name: Mahogany TopVerified Purchase
Putting things together takes a bit of time, not to mention needing to flip the table once constructed. Motor and rod can be a bit hidden rather than exposed. Similarly cables (controller to motor, power socket cable to motor) are just badly exposed, could do with a bit of covering. Structurally very solid, no wobbly going up or down, able to hold heavy objects. Safety stop detection works well, it will stop at impact. Controller memorise settings well, very handy to use any presets. Very satisfied

Amazing Quality
Reviewed in Australia on 28 June 2023Size Name: 100cm TopColour Name: BambooVerified Purchase
I have been enviously eyeing of my partner’s standing desk for almost a year now, so I finally decided it was time to get my own.I purchased this desk as it had really good reviews, but I was still a bit worried about the quality as it was rather “cheap” to purchase.My desk got delivered yesterday and I am very happy to report I was wrong; this thing looks and feels like a million bucks. It was super easy to assemble (I did it by myself in about 20 minutes) and it feels super well made! The materials look and feel great and when you’re assembling everything, everything fits like a glove.For reference my partner’s desk was almost double the price and to me they look almost identical (but mine has a cable box).Today will be my first day working from my new desk and I am super excited!

Great Product
Reviewed in Australia on 25 June 2023Size Name: 120cm TopColour Name: MahoganyVerified Purchase
Very good quality, well made electric standing desk. It comes well packaged and easy to assemble, largely because the motor assembly is already attached to the desktop... so just the frame (legs and feet); control panel; storage box and hooks. The box contains all the assembly tools, and the power cable is long enough.Once built the desk is stable and big enough to hold 2x 32 inch monitors and laptop (it's actually a decent size, bigger than I expected). It moves up and down easily but it's early days... I haven't yet tried the memory functionality; charging or the advertised safety feature. But early indications are that it is a great product and a great purchase - very highly recommended.
