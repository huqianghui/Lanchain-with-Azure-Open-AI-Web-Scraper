                To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Top positive reviewPositive reviews› Benson5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent productReviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023I had an Ikea electric sit and stand desk which is double the price of this and it is nowhere comparable to this desk. This desk has dual motors, the desktop is thicker and stronger and the hydraulic mechanism is way responsive and smoother even the desk has a 19kg piano keyboard and 9 kg monitor + arm combo permanently, plus it has a few memory settings. Highly recommended.

I do not recommend the product.
Reviewed in Australia on 22 September 2023Size Name: 140x70Colour Name: Mahogany TopVerified Purchase
The product is highly unstable, making it difficult to use. The measures are also incorrect, which can lead to inaccurate results. Additionally, the product cannot be changed or modified to suit specific needs, further limiting its usefulness. Overall, I would strongly advise against purchasing this product as it is not cost-effective and may cause more frustration than it's worth.

Faulty products
Reviewed in Australia on 12 May 2023Size Name: 120x60 ProColour Name: Maple TopVerified Purchase
Received the item, after a few days it stopped working and could not clear error messages.The table is stuck at a high level and cannot use it.Reached out to the seller as it’s faulty and the seller wants me to pay to receive the new part to replace the faulty one.They are refusing to send until I make extra payment for their faulty desk.Stay clear of seller.

Table was a little hard to assemble, but looks sturdy and professional once it was done. It came in 2 packages (arrived approx 5 days apart).

A very amazing desk! It is worth to you!
Reviewed in Australia on 24 May 2023Size Name: 120x60 ProColour Name: Maple Top
One of the standout features of this electric standing desk is its effortless adjustability. With just the press of a button, I can effortlessly switch between sitting and standing positions, finding the perfect ergonomic height for my comfort. The silent motor smoothly raises and lowers the desk, allowing for seamless transitions and minimizing any disruptions to my workflow.

Wow! What I needed and affordable! (Long Review + 20 ish days of use)
Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2023Size Name: 120x60Colour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
Review for white 48x24 version.Safe to say I was a little worried to order this due to the hundreds of options I went through. I'm very picky when ordering things like this off of Amazon and read tons of reviews before purchasing. This option was one of the few that barely had complaints, and the ones that did weren't much of a problem for me.By the way, I did build this myself (recommend to have another to help you though, it was a workout and made a dent in my wall in the process but that's my fault lol), so my experience with assembly was more of a struggle but with another person to help, it would be pretty easy.The legs are the heaviest parts, be sure to keep them on the floor and not try to stand them up (bc then you might make a small hole in the wall). I have assembled lots of furniture before, and I recommend to always leave the screws a little loose before tightening them. Sometimes, when one gets tightened, it'll make it seem like the other holes or even one, isn't aligned. I did have one that was slightly unaligned, but I know a little tilted screw doesn't really affect something like this.As for missing holes, I will be honest, I don't remember if I had to make my own. I feel like I didn't, but if you do, just be sure to mark where you make the hole and don't make it too big. Just enough to get the screw settled and then it'll do the rest.The instructions were a little confusing at times, and all I can say is to read them carefully and really look at the diagrams. One part I just had to risk was the cables into the motor, in the instructions they look the same, but not when you plug them in. I included a picture for reference in case someone might need to see it.Finally, I was concerned about putting stuff from my previous desk onto this one, since I'd be moving it up and down, I thought maybe they'd be too heavy. I have some shelves, holders for writing utensils and such, my computer, lamp, and a bunch of other trinket things. And it's holding up great! The shelves don't move or threaten to fall over luckily.Overall, I really enjoy this desk, and I actually really like the desk top material because it's easy to clean, way better than the glass desk I had beforehand!
