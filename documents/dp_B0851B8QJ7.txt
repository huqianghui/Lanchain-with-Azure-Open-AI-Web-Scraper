                How are ratings calculated?
            

                To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Stable and great
Reviewed in Australia on 3 September 2023Size Name: 140x70 ProColour Name: Mahogany TopVerified Purchase
Putting things together takes a bit of time, not to mention needing to flip the table once constructed. Motor and rod can be a bit hidden rather than exposed. Similarly cables (controller to motor, power socket cable to motor) are just badly exposed, could do with a bit of covering. Structurally very solid, no wobbly going up or down, able to hold heavy objects. Safety stop detection works well, it will stop at impact. Controller memorise settings well, very handy to use any presets. Very satisfied

Amazing Quality
Reviewed in Australia on 28 June 2023Size Name: 100cm TopColour Name: BambooVerified Purchase
I have been enviously eyeing of my partner’s standing desk for almost a year now, so I finally decided it was time to get my own.I purchased this desk as it had really good reviews, but I was still a bit worried about the quality as it was rather “cheap” to purchase.My desk got delivered yesterday and I am very happy to report I was wrong; this thing looks and feels like a million bucks. It was super easy to assemble (I did it by myself in about 20 minutes) and it feels super well made! The materials look and feel great and when you’re assembling everything, everything fits like a glove.For reference my partner’s desk was almost double the price and to me they look almost identical (but mine has a cable box).Today will be my first day working from my new desk and I am super excited!

Great Product
Reviewed in Australia on 25 June 2023Size Name: 120cm TopColour Name: MahoganyVerified Purchase
Very good quality, well made electric standing desk. It comes well packaged and easy to assemble, largely because the motor assembly is already attached to the desktop... so just the frame (legs and feet); control panel; storage box and hooks. The box contains all the assembly tools, and the power cable is long enough.Once built the desk is stable and big enough to hold 2x 32 inch monitors and laptop (it's actually a decent size, bigger than I expected). It moves up and down easily but it's early days... I haven't yet tried the memory functionality; charging or the advertised safety feature. But early indications are that it is a great product and a great purchase - very highly recommended.

Wow! What I needed and affordable! (Long Review + 20 ish days of use)
Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2023Size Name: 120x60Colour Name: White TopVerified Purchase
Review for white 48x24 version.Safe to say I was a little worried to order this due to the hundreds of options I went through. I'm very picky when ordering things like this off of Amazon and read tons of reviews before purchasing. This option was one of the few that barely had complaints, and the ones that did weren't much of a problem for me.By the way, I did build this myself (recommend to have another to help you though, it was a workout and made a dent in my wall in the process but that's my fault lol), so my experience with assembly was more of a struggle but with another person to help, it would be pretty easy.The legs are the heaviest parts, be sure to keep them on the floor and not try to stand them up (bc then you might make a small hole in the wall). I have assembled lots of furniture before, and I recommend to always leave the screws a little loose before tightening them. Sometimes, when one gets tightened, it'll make it seem like the other holes or even one, isn't aligned. I did have one that was slightly unaligned, but I know a little tilted screw doesn't really affect something like this.As for missing holes, I will be honest, I don't remember if I had to make my own. I feel like I didn't, but if you do, just be sure to mark where you make the hole and don't make it too big. Just enough to get the screw settled and then it'll do the rest.The instructions were a little confusing at times, and all I can say is to read them carefully and really look at the diagrams. One part I just had to risk was the cables into the motor, in the instructions they look the same, but not when you plug them in. I included a picture for reference in case someone might need to see it.Finally, I was concerned about putting stuff from my previous desk onto this one, since I'd be moving it up and down, I thought maybe they'd be too heavy. I have some shelves, holders for writing utensils and such, my computer, lamp, and a bunch of other trinket things. And it's holding up great! The shelves don't move or threaten to fall over luckily.Overall, I really enjoy this desk, and I actually really like the desk top material because it's easy to clean, way better than the glass desk I had beforehand!
